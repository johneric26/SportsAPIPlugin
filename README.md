## Purpose

Extension of a COVID-era project I built tracking published across various sports books (non-public repo). Thesis had been to aggregate stats from MLB Stats & NFL Stats APIs and run predictive analytics to find mispriced odds.

## Status

Project mothballed as HFT style access to gambling markets proved challenging.
